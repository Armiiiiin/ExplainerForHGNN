# Do We Really Need to Access the meta-path in Heterogeneous Information Networks: An Explainable Graph Neural Network Approach

## Introduction

This repository implements several explainable graph neural network models, and applies them to heterogeneous GNNs.
We do fair comparison between different models and evaluate their performance on several benchmark datasets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10

## Run the code

To run the code, you can use the following command:

```bash
python main.py --dataset {dataset_name} --model {model_name} --explainer {explainer_name}
```
